char *otr_help = "%9- OTR help -%9\nQuick start:  Do \"%_/load otr%_\"  (irssi syntax), write  \"%_?OTR?%_\" to your  OTR buddy,\nwait until the now ongoing key  generation finishes and write \"%_?OTR?%_\" again. You\nshould \"%_go secure%_\".\n\nKey generation happens in a separate  process and its duration mainly depends on\nthe available entropy. On  my desktop it takes about 6  Minutes, about 2 Minutes\nif I run  \"%_du /%_\" in parallel  and on an idle  server system it can  even take an\nhour.\n\nThe  default  OTR  policy  of  irc-otr  is  now  something  between  manual  and\nopportunistic. Manual  means you have to  start it yourself by  issuing \"%_?OTR?%_\",\nopportunistic means  both peers send  some magic  whitespace and start  OTR once\nthey receive this whitespace from the other side. irc-otr uses a mode in between\nwhere we are not sending whitespace as an announcement (as in opportunistic) but\nwe still  handle whitespace if  we see  it from the  other side (I'm  calling it\nhandlews). Therefore if your peer  uses opportunistic the handshake should still\nstart automatically once he writes something.\n\nYou can  now set the  OTR policy  per peer via  the otr_policy /setting.  It's a\ncomma separated  list of \"%_<nick>@<server> <policy>%_\"  pairs where <nick>@<server>\nis interpreted as a glob pattern, i.e. you can use wildcard \"%_*%_\" and joker \"%_?%_\" as\nyou would  in a shell.  The policy  can be one  of never, manual,  handlews (the\ndefault),  opportunistic, and  always. Be  aware that  the opportunistic  policy\nfails with  some IRC  servers since  they strip off  the whitespace.  The always\npolicy has  the nice side effect  that the first  line you type will  already be\nencrypted.\n\nIf  a  fingerprint can  be  found  for someone,  i.e.  someone  you had  an  OTR\nconversation  with  before,  then  the otr_policy_known  setting  applies  after\notr_policy. It has the same syntax. The  default is \"%_* always%_\", i.e. enforce OTR\nwith anyone you've used OTR with before.\n\nShould you finish an OTR session via  \"%_/otr finish%_\" and should the active policy\nbe always  or opportunistic then  it will be  temporarily set back  to handlews.\nOtherwise OTR would start again right away  which is probably not what you want.\nThis is however reset once you close the query window.\n\nTo make  sure that you are  actually talking to your  buddy, you can agree  on a\nsecret somehow  and then one does  \"%_/otr auth <secret>%_\". Shortly  afterwards the\nother  one will  be  asked to  do  the  same and  you're  done. The  traditional\nalternative, comparing  fingerprints over a secure  line, can also be  used. Use\n\"%_/otr trust%_\" once you're sure they match.\n\nI also  strongly recommend to do  \"%_/statusbar window add otr%_\"  (irssi syntax) so\nyou're informed about what's going on.\n\nIn \"%_<client config dir>/otr/otr.{key,fp}%_\" you'll  find the fingerprints and your\nprivate keys(should you at any point be interested).\n\nCommands:\n\n%_/otr genkey nick@irc.server.com %_\n        Manually generate a key for the given account(also done on demand)\n%_/otr auth [<nick>@<server>] <secret>%_\n        Initiate or respond to an authentication challenge\n%_/otr authabort [<nick>@<server>] %_\n        Abort any ongoing authentication\n%_/otr trust [<nick>@<server>]%_\n        Trust the fingerprint of the user in the current window.\n        You should only do this after comparing fingerprints over a secure line\n%_/otr debug%_\n        Switch debug mode on/off\n%_/otr contexts%_\n        List all OTR contexts along with their fingerprints and status\n%_/otr finish [<nick>@<server>]%_\n        Finish an OTR conversation\n%_/otr version%_\n        Display irc-otr version. Might be a git commit\n\nSettings:\n\n%_otr_policy%_\n        Comma-separated list of \"%_<nick>@<server> <policy>%_\" pairs. See comments\n        above.\n%_otr_policy_known%_\n        Same syntax as otr_policy. Only applied where a fingerprint is\n        available.\n%_otr_ignore%_\n        Conversations with nicks that match this regular expression completely\n        bypass libotr. It is very unlikely that you need to touch this setting,\n        just use the OTR policy never to prevent OTR sessions with some nicks.\n%_otr_finishonunload%_\n        If true running OTR sessions are finished on /unload and /quit.\n%_otr_createqueries%_\n        If true queries are automatically created for OTR log messages.\n%9- End of OTR help -%9";
